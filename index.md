These medications are generally recommended for individuals with a BMI of 30 or greater, or a BMI of 27 or greater with weight-related conditions such as high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes. They are most effective when combined with lifestyle changes like a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity【13†source】【14†source】【15†source】.

Semaglutide, known under the brand name Wegovy for weight management, is also marketed under the name Ozempic when used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Both medications contain the same active ingredient, semaglutide, but they are approved and marketed for different primary indications.

- **Wegovy**: Specifically approved for chronic weight management in adults who are obese or overweight with at least one weight-related condition. It is administered as a once-weekly injection.
- **Ozempic**: Approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes to help control blood sugar levels, also administered as a once-weekly injection.

These medications work by mimicking a hormone called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) that targets areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation and food intake【13†source】【15†source】.
